/**
 * An image that holds its own space, shimmers while it loads, and fades in when it arrives.
 *
 * Every photo on this site comes from the dashboard over the network, so without this a card is a
 * flat block of colour that snaps to a photograph — and on a slow connection a page of them pops
 * one tile at a time. The wrapper is sized by the caller, so the layout never shifts either.
 *
 * `img.complete` is checked on mount and on every `src` change, and this is the part that is easy
 * to get wrong: a cached image can finish loading before React attaches `onLoad`, and a component
 * that only listens for the event shimmers forever over a picture that is already there.
